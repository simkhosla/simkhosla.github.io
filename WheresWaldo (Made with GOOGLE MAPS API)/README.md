# Welcome To Me!
Hi there, I'm Simran. Nice to meet ya!

- Servers

####And by the end of this course I'll know:

In a former life, I was a visual journalist.

##Where in the World Is Waldo?
This started as me trying to learn the Google Maps Javascript API and Google Places API. 
Play ANYWHERE in the world by popping in a latitude and longitude up top.

###How It Works:
The Google Places API allows you to search for places nearby the center of the map. 
Using that, I place all the extras on all the cafe's, stores, atms, bus stations and train stations. 
Waldo, Wenda, Odlaw, Wizard Whitebeard and Woof are placed on five schools in the area. 

###Coming soon: 
Eventually, I want to tap into the Google Maps Geocoding service and see if I can have the applet search by any location, not just limited to Lat and Long.
