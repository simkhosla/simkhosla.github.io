# Rock & Roll Slots
This started as me playing around with some tools in canvas to make a slot machine style game. 

###Initialize: 
Get started by picking any of the three bands included and open either "beatles.html", "kiss.html" or "ledzep.html" in a browser of your choice. 

###Play By Band:
Each band has it's own version of the slots game to play, complete with band-themed messages when you win or lose. Here's what all of them look like:

###Adjust Difficulty: 
If you find the game too tough (or too easy) adjust the difficulty (ie. how close the icons have to be to each other for a win), by selecting either EASY, MED or HARD up top.




Play limits and a point system coming soon! Get pumped!
