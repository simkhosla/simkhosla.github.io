# Rock & Roll Slots
This started as me playing around with some tools in canvas to make a slot machine style game. 

###Initialize: 
Get started by picking any of the three bands included and open either "beatles.html", "kiss.html" or "ledzep.html" in a browser of your choice. 

###Play By Band:
Each band has it's own version of the slots game to play, complete with band-themed messages when you win or lose. Here's what all of them look like:

###Object of the Game:
You have 30 tries to see how many times you can line up the slots. Everytime you "win", you'll be treated to a snippet of a song from the band you're playing with. 

###Play With a Friend: 
You can compete with a friend by toggling which player is being scored at the bottom. Click on the player you want to be the 'live player" and that's who will be scored for the round. 

###Adjust Difficulty: 
If you find the game too tough (or too easy) adjust the difficulty (ie. how close the icons have to be to each other for a win), by selecting either EASY, MED or HARD up top.

####Some things that didn't work: 
- It's weirdly hard to do opacity for JUST the background of a div, and other general CSS annoyances
- I was hoping to have more animation on the canvas itself (have the slots actually slide like real slots), BUT turns out you can't use CSS on Canvas so. MEH.
